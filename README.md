## Technical Details

### Libraries and Dependencies

- **Streamlit (1.28+)**: Primary framework for web application development
  - Provides reactive UI components
  - Handles session state management
  - Enables real-time user interaction
- **Random**: Python standard library for question randomization
  - Ensures fair assessment by randomly selecting questions
  - Provides varied interview experiences

### Architecture Overview

The application follows a **state-machine architecture** with the following components:

#### Core Components

1. **Session State Manager**: Tracks application progress and candidate data
2. **Question Generator**: Dynamically creates technical assessments
3. **Data Collector**: Manages progressive information gathering
4. **Summary Generator**: Compiles comprehensive candidate reports

#### Data Flow

```
Start ‚Üí Personal Info Collection ‚Üí Tech Stack Input ‚Üí Question Generation ‚Üí Assessment ‚Üí Summary
```

#### State Management

The application uses Streamlit's session state to maintain:
- **stage**: Current application stage (start, name, email, phone, experience, position, location, tech_stack, tech_questions, summary)
- **candidate**: Dictionary containing all candidate information
- **tech_index**: Current technology being assessed
- **tech_questions**: List of questions for current technology
- **current_question**: Index of current question being asked

### Technical Question Bank Structure

```python
tech_questions = {
    "python": [
        "What are decorators in Python?",
        "Explain list comprehensions.",
        "Difference between list and tuple?"
    ],
    "javascript": [
        "What is event delegation?",
        "Difference between '==' and '==='?",
        "Explain closures in JavaScript."
    ]
}
```

### Model Architecture

The application employs a **sequential processing model**:
- **Linear Progression**: Each stage must be completed before advancing
- **State Validation**: Ensures data integrity at each step
- **Dynamic Branching**: Technical questions adapt based on candidate's tech stack
- **Randomization**: Each technology assessment uses randomly selected questions

## Prompt Design

### Information Gathering Strategy

The application uses a **progressive disclosure approach** to gather information:

1. **Single-Focus Prompts**: Each stage focuses on one piece of information
   - Example: "üëã What's your full name?"
   - Reduces cognitive load and improves completion rates

2. **Contextual Icons**: Visual cues enhance user experience
   - üëã for name collection
   - üìß for email input
   - üõ†Ô∏è for technical stack

3. **Clear Instructions**: Each prompt provides specific guidance
   - Tech stack example: "Comma-separated technologies (e.g. Python, JavaScript)"

### Technical Question Generation

The system employs **adaptive questioning** based on:

1. **Technology Detection**: Parses candidate's tech stack input
2. **Question Bank Selection**: Matches technologies to predefined question sets
3. **Random Sampling**: Selects 3 questions per technology using `random.sample()`
4. **Fallback Mechanism**: Uses default questions for unsupported technologies

### Prompt Crafting Principles

- **Specificity**: Each prompt targets a single data point
- **Clarity**: Instructions are unambiguous and actionable
- **Progression**: Logical flow from basic to complex information
- **Validation**: Implicit validation through required field completion

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Session State Management

**Problem**: Streamlit's stateless nature made it difficult to maintain candidate progress across page reloads and user interactions.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive session state management using `st.session_state` to persist:
- Candidate information across all stages
- Current application stage
- Question progression tracking
- Technical assessment state

### Challenge 2: Dynamic Question Generation

**Problem**: Generating relevant technical questions based on varied and unpredictable tech stack inputs.

**Solution**: 
- Created a structured question bank with predefined categories
- Implemented fallback mechanism for unsupported technologies
- Used random sampling to ensure varied assessments
- Normalized input (lowercase, stripped) for consistent matching

### Challenge 3: Progressive Form Flow

**Problem**: Creating a smooth, intuitive multi-step form experience without overwhelming users.

**Solution**:
- Implemented single-focus stages with automatic progression
- Added visual feedback and clear instructions
- Used `st.rerun()` for seamless state transitions
- Provided contextual prompts with relevant icons

### Challenge 4: Technical Assessment Scalability

**Problem**: Extending the system to support additional programming languages and technologies.

**Solution**:
- Designed modular question bank structure
- Implemented flexible question generation function
- Created default question fallback for unsupported technologies
- Used consistent data structures for easy expansion

### Challenge 5: Data Validation and Completion

**Problem**: Ensuring all required information is collected before progression.

**Solution**:
- Implemented implicit validation through conditional rendering
- Required input completion before stage advancement
- Provided clear success feedback upon completion
- Added comprehensive summary validation

### Challenge 6: User Experience Optimization

**Problem**: Balancing thoroughness with user engagement and completion rates.

**Solution**:
- Broke complex forms into digestible single-question stages
- Added progress indicators and celebratory elements (balloons)
- Provided immediate feedback and clear next steps
- Maintained consistent visual design throughout

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Extended Technology Support**: Add support for additional programming languages and frameworks
2. **Difficulty Scaling**: Implement adaptive questioning based on experience level
3. **Data Export**: Add CSV/PDF export functionality for candidate data
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Provide insights into candidate performance and trends
5. **Integration Capabilities**: Connect with HR management systems and databases

### Technical Improvements

- **Database Integration**: Replace session state with persistent storage
- **Authentication**: Add user management and secure access
- **Question Bank Management**: Admin interface for question maintenance
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement caching for improved response times
